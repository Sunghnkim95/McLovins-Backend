# McLovins-
Grace Shopper Project

Manufactured a fully functioning backend database and API, deployed via heroku. This portion of the project consists of Express, Morgan, jsonwebtoken, bcrypts, and more.

The project was assigned by Fullstack Academy as a final capstone project, using all the materials we've learned throughout the course. Many challenges were faced in this project as it was the first non-guided project we had to face head on utilizing everything we could. The most challenging segment was dealing with the carts and its functionality and interaction with other bits of the project. How to deal with cartItems, how are we going to save the cart when user is not logged in/is logged in, how do we make the cart inactive after "purchase", how should we go about saving cartitems when not logged in but then the user logs in, and much more.

The project was a great challenge to over within the 4 weeks given, but a huge joy to work with. It helped clarify many misunderstandings and learned many new functions along the way.
